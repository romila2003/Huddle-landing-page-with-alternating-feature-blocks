## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS (SCSS)
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I completed another project that tested my layout skills. This was easier than the previous challenge as I had to clip the image of however with this, the layout seems easier to structure. The only difficulty I had with this aligning the header (navbar and content) which I solved through wrapping it with a `div`. In this project, I did not learn new concepts but instead, focused more on practicing web layouts to feel more comfortable in that area.

### Continued development

For future developments, I want to continue making responsive web layouts and feel more confident with it. Also, I want to implement more JS into my work such as a nav-bar.
